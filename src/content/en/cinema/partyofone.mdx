More than merely a portrayal of the Emmering Volunteer Fire Brigade, this film serves as a mirror to contemporary society. *Party of One* delves into profound themes of duty, solidarity, and the intrinsic worth of voluntary service. It tells the compelling stories of those with the courage to stand up for others, alongside a younger generation striving to find its place in a world that is evolving at an unprecedented pace.

A visually and sonically immersive experience that inspires, moves, and provokes deep contemplation.
