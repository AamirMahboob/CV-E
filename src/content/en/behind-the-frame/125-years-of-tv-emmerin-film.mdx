# 125 Years of TV Emmering – A Cinematic Journey

I was honoured with the extraordinary task of creating a documentary film about the 125-year history of TV Emmering, an immense challenge given that the club chronicle spanned an impressive 1,200 pages. How could such an extensive body of information be transformed into a compelling and concise film of under 45 minutes? Fortunately, I had the invaluable support of **Manfred Sinner**, an individual with a sharp mind, a keen eye for essentials, and a deep understanding of the club’s history. Together, we developed a strategy that allowed us to translate this complex content into a gripping cinematic narrative.

## A Journey Through Time

From the outset, it was clear that the story had to span from the club’s foundation in **1898** through the post-World War II era and beyond. Particular attention was given to influential club figures and defining moments in its history. Time and again, Manfred emphasised the significance of certain historical images and documents in shaping the narrative. My task was to weave them into a cohesive storyline. It quickly became evident that this journey through time needed **a bicycle**.

And so, the idea of a **road trip** was born. Using the bicycle as a linking element between different chapters, we were able to establish a clear structure. Each section was meticulously planned, discussed, and then executed. The balance between preparation and spontaneity worked seamlessly. While I refined one chapter, Manfred was already conceptualising the next. Step by step, a coherent and visually stunning concept took shape.

## The Film’s Premiere

The final film was presented at the club's **125th-anniversary meeting**, receiving overwhelming enthusiasm and emotional reactions from its members. It was a moment that underscored the value of the time, effort, and dedication invested in the project.

A special thanks goes to **Limelight Veranstaltungstechnik**, who generously provided high-end projection equipment and a large screen at an exceptionally fair price for the presentation event. Without this technical support, the film’s impact would not have been as profound.

This project was more than just a film. It was **a journey through history, a creative challenge, and a collaborative experience** that will stay with me for a long time.

## The Accompanying Book – Long Live Sport

The accompanying book for the special exhibition **Long Live Sport** was created to document its historical and cultural content. It brings together a wealth of material, making the club’s history vivid and accessible.

Through the extensive digitisation of the **1,200-page club chronicle**, valuable content was incorporated into the book. These contributions enrich the book both visually and in substance.

- **The extensive club chronicle was fully digitised** and processed in high quality.  
- **Numerous digitised images and historical documents** were strategically incorporated into the book.  
- **The digital processing helped to create a clear and engaging structure** for the book.  

The book serves not only as a record of the exhibition but also as a **lasting archive of valuable club history**.

## Refining the Film for the Special Exhibition

Originally, the film **125 Years of TV Emmering** was created exclusively for the Emmering Gymnastics Club. After its successful premiere, the project was considered complete.

However, through research conducted by the **Jexhof Farm Museum** for the special exhibition **Long Live Sport**, the film was revisited. **Manfred Sinner** facilitated the connection, leading to additional edits and refinements.

- The film was **shortened to 15 minutes** to fit the exhibition’s format, focusing only on key scenes. It was also provided with **English subtitles**.  
- Originally produced in **Digital Cinema Package (DCP)** format for cinema screenings, the film maintained exceptional visual and audio quality. Since the museum's equipment was incompatible with DCP, it was **converted into a more accessible MP4 format**, ensuring seamless playback on exhibition monitors.  

## Visual and Structural Adjustments

Filmed in a **2.41:1 aspect ratio**, the film naturally displayed **black bars** on standard monitors. This design element was intentionally utilised:

- **The upper bar displayed information** about where to watch the full-length film.  
- **The lower bar contained English subtitles**, ensuring accessibility even without sound. The decision to use subtitles was made intentionally, as the museum’s playback system only supported headphone output. This allowed the film’s impact to remain intact, regardless of audio limitations.  

The adapted film was seamlessly integrated into the exhibition, displayed on monitors that met the technical requirements.

## A Film Beyond the Screen

These precise adjustments ensured that the film was not only technically compatible but also **visually engaging and thematically effective**.  
It contributed not only as a cinematic piece but also as **a cultural asset to the exhibition**.
